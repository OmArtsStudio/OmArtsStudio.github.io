Welcome!

Hey, I’m Tejas Tandel ! I’m a freelance artist  who loves to make any type of artwork from abstracts to realism.

I started making art with our team because I love drawing, being creative, and expressing myself in other ways.

I believe in supporting my clients through every step of their journey, from the initial consultation to providing feedback on the final product.

I hope to inspire you with our work!
